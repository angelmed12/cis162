      Hello! My name is Angel Medina, transferring to UC San Diego! I am studying Computer Science & Elecrtrical Engineering, and I can't wait to learn something new everyday! I enjoy fishkeeping, which is a hobby of mine since I was a little kid. I also like to watch the Flash on the CW! I can't wait to work with some of you during this course!
